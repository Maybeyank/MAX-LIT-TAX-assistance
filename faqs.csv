Form 16 is essential for filing your income tax return as it provides most of the information needed."
Basics,"What is TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)?","TDS is a system introduced by the Income Tax Department to collect tax at the source of income. Under this system, the person making a payment (like your employer) deducts a certain percentage of tax before making the full payment to you. For salaried employees, employers deduct TDS monthly based on your estimated annual income and tax liability. This ensures a steady flow of revenue for the government and reduces the burden of lump-sum tax payment at the end of the year."
