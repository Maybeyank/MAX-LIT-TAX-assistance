                question: "What is Income Tax Return (ITR)?",
                answer: "An Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form that taxpayers use to report their income and taxes paid to the Income Tax Department. It includes details of your income from various sources like salary, business, property, capital gains, and other sources, along with details of taxes paid during the financial year."
            },
            {
                category: "Basics",
                question: "Why is filing ITR important even if my tax is already deducted (TDS)?",
                answer: "Filing ITR is important for several reasons, even if your tax has already been deducted: Legal Requirement: If your income exceeds the basic exemption limit, filing ITR is mandatory. Proof of Income: ITR serves as legal proof of your income for various purposes like loan applications, visa processing, etc. Refund Claims: If excess tax has been deducted, you can claim a refund only by filing ITR. Tax Compliance: It helps maintain transparency with tax authorities and avoids future complications. Carry Forward Losses: Business or capital losses can only be carried forward if ITR is filed."

                category: "Basics",
                question: "What's the difference between a Financial Year (FY) and an Assessment Year (AY)?",
                answer: "Financial Year (FY): This is the year in which you earn your income. It runs from April 1st to March 31st of the next year. For example, FY 2024-25 covers the period from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. Assessment Year (AY): This is the year immediately following the financial year in which the income earned during the FY is assessed for tax purposes. For FY 2024-25, the AY would be 2025-26."

                category: "Basics",
                question: "What is a PAN card and why do I need it for taxes?",
                answer: "PAN (Permanent Account Number) is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric identifier issued by the Income Tax Department. It's essential for: Filing income tax returns, Paying taxes, Opening bank accounts, Making high-value transactions (over ₹2.5 lakhs), Investing in mutual funds, shares, etc. PAN helps the tax department track financial transactions and prevent tax evasion."

                category: "Basics",
                question: "My company gave me a Form 16. What is it for?",
                answer: "Form 16 is a certificate issued by your employer that contains details of your salary income and the tax deducted at source (TDS) during the financial year. It consists of two parts: Part A: Contains employer and employee details, TDS details, and a summary of tax deducted. Part B: Contains a detailed breakdown of salary, other income declared by you, deductions claimed, and tax computation. Form 16 is essential for filing your income tax return as it provides most of the information needed."

            {
                category: "Basics",
                question: "What is TDS (Tax Deducted at Source)?",
                answer: "TDS is a system introduced by the Income Tax Department to collect tax at the source of income. Under this system, the person making a payment (like your employer) deducts a certain percentage of tax before making the full payment to you. For salaried employees, employers deduct TDS monthly based on your estimated annual income and tax liability. This ensures a steady flow of revenue for the government and reduces the burden of lump-sum tax payment at the end of the year."

                question: "Who is required to file an income tax return in India?",
                answer: "You are required to file an ITR if your total income exceeds the basic exemption limit in a financial year. For FY 2024-25: Individuals below 60 years: ₹3,00,000, Senior citizens (60-79 years): ₹3,00,000, Super senior citizens (80+ years): ₹5,00,000. Additionally, ITR must be filed regardless of income level if: You have assets or signing authority in foreign accounts, You receive income from more than one source, You have capital gains from sale of assets, You are a company or firm, regardless of profit or loss."

                category: "Applicability",
                question: "Is there a minimum income level below which I don't have to file ITR?",
                answer: "Yes, if your total income is below the basic exemption limit, you're not required to file an ITR. However, it's still advisable to file if: You want to claim a refund of TDS, You have high-value transactions that require PAN, You want to establish a credit history for future loans."

            {
                category: "Applicability",
                question: "My income is less than 2.5 lakhs. Should I still file an ITR?",
                answer: "While not mandatory, filing ITR even with income below ₹2.5 lakhs has benefits: Refund Claims: If any TDS was deducted, you can claim it back, Financial Credibility: ITR serves as proof of income for loans, visas, etc., Future Planning: Establishes a tax filing history, Government Schemes: Some schemes require ITR as proof of income. It's a good financial practice to file ITR regardless of income level."

                question: "What is the due date for filing ITR for a salaried person?",
                answer: "For most individual taxpayers (including salaried employees), the due date for filing ITR is: July 31st of the assessment year for FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26). For example, for the financial year 2024-25 (April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025), the due date for filing ITR is July 31, 2025.

                category: "Deadlines & Penalties",
                question: "What happens if I miss the deadline for filing my tax return?",
                answer: "If you miss the ITR filing deadline, several consequences may apply: Late Filing Fee: You'll have to pay a late filing fee under Section 234F: Up to ₹1,000 if filed before December 31st of the AY, Up to ₹10,000 if filed after December 31st of the AY, Maximum ₹1,000 for taxpayers with income up to ₹5 lakhs. Interest on Outstanding Tax: Interest at 1% per month under Section 234A from the due date until the date of filing. Loss Carry Forward: Business losses or capital losses cannot be carried forward if ITR is filed late. Notice from IT Department: You may receive notices for delayed filing. However, you can still file a belated return up to March 31st of the next year (or completion of assessment, whichever is earlier)."

                category: "Filing Process",
                question: "What documents do I need to keep ready before filing my ITR?",
                answer: "Essential documents for ITR filing include: PAN Card, Form 16 (from employer), Bank Statements (to report interest income), Form 26AS (tax credit statement), Investment Proofs (for deductions claimed), Home Loan Documents (if applicable), Property Documents (if you have rental income), Capital Gains Statements (if you sold assets), Proof of Donations (for 80G deductions), Aadhaar Card. Gathering these documents before starting the ITR process will make filing much smoother."

                question: "What is the difference between the Old and New Tax Regime?",
                answer: "The key differences between the two tax regimes are: Tax Slabs - Old Regime: More slabs with higher rates, New Regime: Fewer slabs with lower rates. Deductions - Old Regime: Many deductions available (80C, 80D, HRA, etc.), New Regime: Limited deductions (Standard deduction only). Standard Deduction - Old Regime: ₹50,000, New Regime: ₹75,000 (increased from ₹50,000). Choice - Old Regime: Default option, New Regime: Optional (can switch back to old). The new regime offers lower tax rates but fewer deductions, while the old regime has higher rates but more deductions."

                question: "Which tax regime should I choose as a new earner?",
                answer: "As a new earner, the choice depends on your investment habits and income level: Choose New Regime if: Your income is below ₹15 lakhs, You don't make significant investments in tax-saving instruments, You prefer simplicity in tax filing, You don't have home loans or significant HRA claims. Choose Old Regime if: You invest significantly in 80C instruments (PPF, ELSS, etc.), You have a home loan with substantial interest payments, You pay high rent and can claim HRA exemption, Your total deductions exceed the benefit of lower tax rates. Our Intelligent Tax Assistant can help you compare both regimes based on your specific financial situation."
