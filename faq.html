                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>An Income Tax Return (ITR) is a form that taxpayers use to report their income and taxes paid to the Income Tax Department. It includes details of your income from various sources like salary, business, property, capital gains, and other sources, along with details of taxes paid during the financial year.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Filing ITR is important for several reasons, even if your tax has already been deducted:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Legal Requirement:</strong> If your income exceeds the basic exemption limit, filing ITR is mandatory.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proof of Income:</strong> ITR serves as legal proof of your income for various purposes like loan applications, visa processing, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Refund Claims:</strong> If excess tax has been deducted, you can claim a refund only by filing ITR.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tax Compliance:</strong> It helps maintain transparency with tax authorities and avoids future complications.</li>
                            <li><strong>Carry Forward Losses:</strong> Business or capital losses can only be carried forward if ITR is filed.</li>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p><strong>Financial Year (FY):</strong> This is the year in which you earn your income. It runs from April 1st to March 31st of the next year. For example, FY 2024-25 covers the period from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025.</p>
                        <p><strong>Assessment Year (AY):</strong> This is the year immediately following the financial year in which the income earned during the FY is assessed for tax purposes. For FY 2024-25, the AY would be 2025-26.</p>

                            <li>Filing income tax returns</li>

                        <p>Form 16 is a certificate issued by your employer that contains details of your salary income and the tax deducted at source (TDS) during the financial year. It consists of two parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Part A:</strong> Contains employer and employee details, TDS details, and a summary of tax deducted.</li>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>TDS is a system introduced by the Income Tax Department to collect tax at the source of income. Under this system, the person making a payment (like your employer) deducts a certain percentage of tax before making the full payment to you.</p>
                        <p>For salaried employees, employers deduct TDS monthly based on your estimated annual income and tax liability. This ensures a steady flow of revenue for the government and reduces the burden of lump-sum tax payment at the end of the year.</p>

                        <p>While not mandatory, filing ITR even with income below ₹2.5 lakhs has benefits:</p>

                            <li><strong>Refund Claims:</strong> If any TDS was deducted, you can claim it back</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial Credibility:</strong> ITR serves as proof of income for loans, visas, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Future Planning:</strong> Establishes a tax filing history</li>

                        <p>Standard Deduction is a flat deduction available to all salaried employees and pensioners. For FY 2024-25:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Old Regime:</strong> ₹50,000</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>A tax refund occurs when you've paid more tax than your actual liability during the financial year. Common reasons include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Excess TDS deducted by employer</li>

                            <li>Investments made during the year</li>

                        <p><strong>Refund Timeline:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> 2-4 weeks after ITR is processed</li>
                            <li><strong>Credit to Bank:</strong> Additional 1-3 weeks after processing</li>
                            <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> Usually 4-8 weeks from ITR processing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To expedite refund:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure your bank account details are correct in your profile</li>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, you can correct mistakes in your filed ITR through a process called "Rectification". Here's how:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Login:</strong> Access the income tax portal with your credentials</li>
                            <li><strong>Navigate:</strong> Go to "e-File" → "Income Tax Returns" → "View Returns/Forms"</li>
                            <li><strong>Select:</strong> Choose the relevant assessment year and click "Rectification"</li>
                            <li><strong>Correct:</strong> Make the necessary changes in the return</li>
                            <li><strong>Submit:</strong> Submit the rectified return</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Important Points:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can only rectify certain types of errors (mathematical errors, missing claims, etc.)</li>
                            <li>You cannot change the ITR form type through rectification</li>
                            <li>You cannot add new sources of income that weren't originally reported</li>
                            <li>Rectification can be done multiple times until the assessment is completed</li>
                            <li>The department may also initiate rectification based on their review</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For major errors or omissions, you may need to file a revised return instead.</p>
